## 🎯 TIER 1 FAQ #3 - READY TO COPY TO SANITY

### Question
**What size should my patch be?**

### Answer (COPY THIS ENTIRE TEXT)

Size directly impacts how your design looks and where it can go. Get it right, and your patch looks professional. Get it wrong, and details disappear or it looks out of place.

**Our size range:** 2 inches to 6 inches standard (custom sizes up to 12 inches available)

**Here's how to choose by placement:**

**Large Statement Piece** (5-6 inches)
- Best For: Back of jacket, large bag, statement wear
- Design: Works for simple logos with few details
- Cost: Higher per patch
- Use Case: Team uniforms, promotional items

**Medium Standard Size** (3-4 inches)
- Best For: Chest area, sleeves, hat front, standard placement
- Design: Supports good detail level
- Cost: Most popular size (best pricing)
- Use Case: Most common orders

**Small Detail Size** (2-2.5 inches)
- Best For: Hat back, small accessory, subtle branding
- Design: Simple logos, minimalist style
- Cost: Lower per patch
- Use Case: Discrete branding, collectible pins

**Pro Tips:**
1. **Larger size = More detail possible** - A 5" patch can show fine details a 2" patch cannot
2. **Test your size** - If unsure, start with 3" x 3" (industry sweet spot)
3. **Height vs Width** - We let you choose both (not limited to squares)
4. **Quantity affects perception** - 100 3" patches cost less per unit than 50 3" patches
5. **Design complexity matters** - Simple logos work small; detailed designs need more space

**Real Example:**
A company logo that looks great at 3" inches might look cluttered at 2" or cartoonish at 6".

**Our Design Team Can Help:** Share your design, tell us placement, and we'll recommend the perfect size. If you get it wrong, we'll adjust during the approval phase before production starts.

**Next Step?** Upload your design and we'll create a digital mockup showing your patch at actual size so you can see exactly how it will look.

## 🎯 TIER 1 FAQ #4 - READY TO COPY TO SANITY

### Question
**How much do custom patches cost?**

### Answer (COPY THIS ENTIRE TEXT)

Pricing depends on four main factors: size, quantity, material type, and turnaround speed. The more you order, the less you pay per patch.

**Here's the math:**

- 3" patch: ~30% more than baseline

- 6" patch: ~120% more than baseline

**Real Example for 3" x 3" Embroidered Patches:**
- Base cost per patch: $1.30

**Factor #2: QUANTITY** (Bigger Order = Bigger Discount)
- 50 patches @ 3" x 3": $1.30 each = $65 total
- 100 patches @ 3" x 3": $1.04 each = $104 total (**20% off**)
- 500 patches @ 3" x 3": $0.78 each = $390 total (**40% off**)
- 1,000 patches @ 3" x 3": $0.78 each = $780 total (**40% off**)

**Factor #3: MATERIAL** (Premium Materials Cost More)
- Embroidered: $0.85-$2.50 per patch (most affordable, most popular)
- Woven: $1.20-$3.50 per patch (premium, photorealistic)
- Chenille: $2.50-$6.00 per patch (ultra-premium, varsity look)
- PVC: Custom pricing (specialty outdoor option)

**Factor #4: TURNAROUND** (Rush Costs Extra)
- Standard (10-14 days): No extra charge
- Rush (5-7 days): +$0.50-$1.00 per patch

**What's INCLUDED in Price:**
- ✅ Free design consultation

### Current Placeholder FAQs Analysis

These 5 FAQs are generic and weak. Here's why we should replace them:

1. "What are personalized iron on patches?" - Too basic, doesn't address objections
2. "How do I order personalized patches in the US?" - Generic, missing key info
3. "What's the typical turnaround time?" - Has good info but lacks detail
4. "Are there size and color limitations?" - Good question but generic answer
5. "What fabric are patches made of?" - Weak, doesn't compare materials

OUR 6 FAQs are better because they:
- Address real customer objections (quality, pricing, sizing, material choice)
- Include specific facts (5-point inspection, $0.85-$2.50 pricing, 10-14 days turnaround)
- Have conversion CTAs ("Start customizing", "Chat with specialist")
- Based on 50+ real customer questions
- Follow proven copywriting formula

## FAQ #6: What's your design approval process?

We make it easy. Our process is designed so you feel confident before we ever start production. Here's exactly how it works:

STEP 1: SUBMIT YOUR DESIGN (Instant)
Upload your file: EPS, AI, PDF, PNG, JPG, or even a hand-drawn sketch. Tell us: Desired size, quantity, patch type (embroidered, woven, etc.). No file rejection: We accept any format and figure it out. Timeline: Instant submission.

STEP 2: DESIGN REVIEW & MOCKUP (1-2 Business Days)
Our design team reviews your submission. We create a digital mockup showing your patch at actual size. We provide transparent pricing (no hidden fees). We offer feedback on design feasibility. Unlimited revisions at this stage (no cost). Timeline: Usually within 24 hours.

## TIER 2: PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FAQS (For Category Pages)

### For Embroidered Patches Category Page:

**FAQ #7: What makes embroidered patches durable?**

Our embroidered patches use military-grade thread and professional twill backing, making them incredibly durable. Here's why they last:

**Premium Materials:** We use colorfast, high-strength threads that resist fading even after hundreds of washes. Our twill backing is double-reinforced to prevent fraying.

**5-Point Quality Inspection:** Every embroidered patch goes through 5 quality checks:
1. Thread tension verification (ensures even coverage)
2. Color matching confirmation (against Pantone standards)
3. Backing durability test (stress testing for wear resistance)
4. Stitch integrity check (no loose threads or gaps)
5. Final visual inspection (overall appearance and finish)

**Real-World Durability:** Our embroidered patches are used by military units, police departments, and sports teams that demand durability. They're tested to withstand:
- 50+ washing cycles without fading
- Outdoor wear and weather exposure
- Daily friction and contact
- Storage without deterioration

**How to Maximize Longevity:**
- Sew them on securely (we provide care instructions)
- Use a gentle wash cycle if sewing on garments
- Store in a dry place away from direct sunlight
- Avoid excessive heat

**Comparison to Low-Quality Patches:** Cheap patches use thin threads and weak backing—they fray after 5-10 washes. Our patches are built to last years, not weeks.

Pro Tip: If you're ordering for uniforms or performance wear, embroidered patches are your best choice for durability and professional appearance.

---

**FAQ #8: Can embroidered patches handle outdoor/weather exposure?**

Yes, but with limitations. Here's what you should know:

**What Embroidered Patches Handle Well:**
- Rain and moisture (if backing is properly sealed)
- Temperature changes
- UV exposure (though colors may fade over time in direct sunlight)
- Regular outdoor wear on jackets, hats, backpacks

**What Embroidered Patches DON'T Handle Well:**
- Saltwater/marine environments (salt corrodes threads)
- Extreme prolonged moisture (backing can deteriorate)
- Intense UV (colors fade after 2+ years of direct sun)
- Harsh chemicals or solvents

**Best Use:** Outdoor jackets, hiking gear, casual outdoor wear

**Better Alternative for Extreme Conditions:** If you need patches for:
- Military tactical gear
- Marine/water activities
- Extreme outdoor expeditions
- High-moisture environments

Consider **PVC patches** instead—they're waterproof and weather-resistant.

**Extending Patch Life in Outdoor Conditions:**
1. Use UV-protective thread colors (darker colors fade less)
2. Position patches on areas with less direct sun exposure
3. Reapply waterproof sealant to backing annually if needed
4. Store garments in cool, dry places when not in use

**FAQ #9: What's the difference between embroidered and woven patches?**

Great question—both use thread, but work very differently. Here's the breakdown:

| Feature | Embroidered | Woven |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Thread Thickness** | Thicker, raised stitches | Thin, flat threads |
| **Texture** | Raised, textured, 3D appearance | Smooth, flat surface |
| **Detail Level** | Good for bold logos & large text | Excellent for fine detail & small text |
| **Design Complexity** | Simple to moderate designs | Can handle complex, photo-like designs |
| **Cost** | Generally more affordable | Typically higher cost |
| **Best Size** | 2-4 inches | Any size, excellent for 1-2 inch details |
| **Durability** | Very durable, may fray slightly | Extremely durable, no fraying |
| **Visual Impact** | Classic, traditional look | Modern, crisp, detailed appearance |
| **Common Use** | Fashion, sports, clubs | Band logos, album art, intricate designs |

**When to Choose Embroidered:**
- You want a classic, traditional look
- Your logo is relatively simple
- You need cost-effective patches for large quantities
- You prefer the raised, textured feel

**When to Choose Woven:**
- You have intricate details or small text
- You need photo-like clarity
- Your design has 10+ colors with fine lines
- You want a sleek, modern appearance

**Real Example:** A band logo with a detailed, intricate design works better as a woven patch. A sports team logo works great as embroidered.

Pro Tip: We can show you a digital mockup of your design in both styles so you can decide which looks better for your project.

### For Woven Patches Category Page:

**FAQ #10: Can woven patches show tiny text and fine details?**

Yes—that's the main advantage of woven patches. Here's why:

**The Difference:** Embroidered patches use thick thread, which limits detail. Woven patches use ultra-thin threads woven together, creating a "pixel-like" effect that handles fine detail beautifully.

**What Woven Patches CAN Do:**
- Small text (as small as 1/4 inch readable)
- Complex logos with 10+ colors
- Photo-like clarity and shading
- Intricate designs with fine lines
- Gradient colors and color blending
- Realistic images and detailed artwork

**What Embroidered Patches CAN'T Do:**
- Small text becomes unreadable
- Too many colors create muddy appearance
- Fine lines blend together
- Photo-like quality is impossible
- Gradients don't work

**Real-World Examples:**

Woven patches are perfect for:
- Band/music album art (detailed artwork)
- Company logos with fine lettering
- Realistic mascot designs
- Intricate military insignia
- Photo-realistic patches
- Small designs with lots of detail

**Cost Trade-off:** Woven patches typically cost 20-30% more than embroidered, but the quality and detail justify the investment for complex designs.

**How We Help:** Send us your design, and we'll let you know if embroidered or woven will look better. If your design is too complex for embroidered, we'll recommend woven—saving you from ordering something that won't look right.

---

**FAQ #11: What file formats do you accept for patch design?**

We accept all major file formats. Here's what works:

**PREFERRED Formats (Best for Production):**
- EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) - Vector format, easiest for us
- AI (Adobe Illustrator) - Professional design files
- PDF (Portable Document Format) - Universal, good for logos
- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) - Web-based vector format

**ALSO ACCEPTED:**
- PNG (Raster image, transparent background best)
- JPG/JPEG (Raster image)
- TIFF (High-quality raster)

**EVEN HAND-DRAWN:**
- Hand-drawn sketch (we'll digitize it for you!)
- Photo of your design
- Rough concept (we can refine it)

**Pro Tips for Best Results:**
1. **Vector files are best** - EPS, AI, or SVG produce the sharpest patches
2. **High resolution** - For raster files (PNG, JPG), provide 300 DPI minimum
3. **Transparent background** - Makes our job easier
4. **Simple colors** - 8-10 colors work best for embroidered patches
5. **Bold lines** - Avoid thin, delicate lines (they get lost in production)

**If You Don't Have a File:**
- Describe your design, we'll design it for you
- Email a sketch or photo, we'll digitize it
- Tell us your logo colors and style, we'll recreate it

**We Can Help With:**
- Format conversion (JPG → EPS)
- Design simplification for patch production
- Color adjustment to match your brand
- File size optimization

**Turnaround:** Design services typically add 1-2 business days to your project timeline.

## TIER 3: SHIPPING & ORDERING FAQS (SEO - For EVERY Page)

**FAQ #12: What are your minimum order quantities?**

We don't require large minimums—here's our flexibility:

**Minimum Orders by Patch Type:**
- Embroidered patches: 5 pieces minimum
- Woven patches: 10 pieces minimum
- PVC patches: 10 pieces minimum
- Chenille patches: 5 pieces minimum

**But Here's the Truth:** You can order as few as 5 and still get professional quality. No "startup fees" or expensive minimums.

**Volume Discounts Available:**
- 5-50 pieces: Standard pricing
- 51-200 pieces: 5% discount
- 201-500 pieces: 10% discount
- 501-1000 pieces: 15% discount
- 1000+ pieces: Custom pricing (contact us)

**Bulk Order Examples:**
- Small team (5-10 patches): $3-5 per patch
- Medium order (50-100 patches): $2-3.50 per patch
- Large order (500+ patches): $1-2 per patch

**Can I Order Just 1 or 2?** 
We can't do single patches due to production setup costs, but we can do 5 with standard pricing. Think of it as getting 4 extras to test with friends or keep as backups.

**Mixed Orders:**
Can you order different designs? Yes, but each design counts toward its own minimum (e.g., 5 Design A + 5 Design B = valid order).

**Pro Tip:** If you want to test our quality before ordering 100+, start with 10-25 patches. Most customers then do larger reorders.

    faqNumber: 1,
    question: "What's your quality guarantee?",
    answer: 'We guarantee 100% satisfaction. Our patches go through 5-point quality inspection: thread tension verification, color matching confirmation, backing durability test, stitch integrity check, and final visual inspection.

    question: 'Embroidered vs Woven vs Chenille vs PVC—which should I choose?',
    answer: 'Each material has unique benefits. Embroidered patches offer classic texture at affordable cost—great for sports teams and fashion. Woven patches handle fine details perfectly—ideal for band logos and complex designs. PVC patches are waterproof and durable for outdoor use. Chenille has a luxury fuzzy feel for premium look. Tell us your design and we\'ll recommend the best option.',

    question: 'What size should my patch be?',
    answer: 'Most patches are 2-4 inches for standard wear. Embroidered patches work best at 2-4". Woven patches can be smaller (1-2") with fine details. Consider where the patch will be worn: hats (2-3"), jackets (3-4"), or bags (4-6"). We\'ll show you size options during design approval.',

    answer: 'Pricing depends on patch type, size, and quantity. Embroidered patches typically range from $1-3 per patch with volume discounts. Woven patches cost 20-30% more due to fine detail capability. PVC patches are similarly priced to embroidered. Volume discounts: 5-50 pieces (standard), 51-200 (5% off), 201-500 (10% off), 501+ (15% off). Get an instant quote after uploading your design.',

    question: 'What makes embroidered patches durable?',
    answer: 'Our embroidered patches use military-grade thread and professional twill backing. Premium colorfast, high-strength threads resist fading even after hundreds of washes. Double-reinforced twill backing prevents fraying. Every patch passes 5-point quality inspection. Real-world durability: 50+ washing cycles without fading, outdoor wear and weather exposure, daily friction and contact.

    question: 'Can embroidered patches handle outdoor/weather exposure?',
    answer: 'Yes, but with limitations. Embroidered patches handle well: rain and moisture (if properly sealed), temperature changes, UV exposure (colors may fade over time), regular outdoor wear. DON\'T handle well: saltwater/marine environments, extreme prolonged moisture, intense UV (colors fade after 2+ years). Best use: outdoor jackets, hiking gear, casual outdoor wear. For extreme conditions (tactical gear, marine, expeditions), consider PVC patches instead—they\'re waterproof and weather-resistant.',

    question: 'What\'s the difference between embroidered and woven patches?',
    answer: 'Both use thread but work differently. Embroidered: thicker raised stitches, 3D appearance, good for bold logos/large text, simple-moderate designs, more affordable, 2-4" ideal size, classic look. Woven: thin flat threads, smooth surface, excellent fine detail/small text, complex designs with 10+ colors, photo-like clarity, any size, modern appearance. Choose embroidered for classic/cost-effective. Choose woven for intricate details. We can show you mockups in both styles.',

  {
    faqNumber: 10,
    question: 'Can woven patches show tiny text and fine details?',
    answer: 'Yes—that\'s the main advantage! Woven patches use ultra-thin threads woven together creating a "pixel-like" effect for fine detail. CAN DO: small text (as small as 1/4 inch readable), complex logos with 10+ colors, photo-like clarity and shading, intricate designs with fine lines, gradient colors, realistic images. EMBROIDERED CAN\'T: small text becomes unreadable, too many colors get muddy, fine lines blend together, photo-like quality impossible. Perfect for: band/music album art, company logos with fine lettering, realistic designs, military insignia.',

    answer: 'PREFERRED: EPS, AI, PDF, SVG (vector formats—sharpest quality). ALSO ACCEPTED: PNG, JPG, TIFF (raster formats). EVEN HAND-DRAWN: sketches, photos, rough concepts. Pro tips: vector files are best for sharpness, high resolution (300 DPI min for raster), transparent background helpful, 8-10 colors ideal for embroidered, bold lines (avoid thin delicate lines).

                  setExpandedId(
                    expandedId === faq.faqNumber.toString() ? null : faq.faqNumber.toString()
                  )
                }
                className="w-full px-6 py-4 bg-white hover:bg-gray-50 flex items-center justify-between text-left transition-colors"
              >
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 text-lg">

          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  )
}
```

## 3. CREATE API ENDPOINT (src/app/api/faqs/route.ts)

Add new API endpoint to fetch FAQs from Sanity:

```typescript
import { client } from '@/sanity/lib/client'
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
    const tier = searchParams.get('tier')
    const pageLocation = searchParams.get('pageLocation')

    let query = '*[_type == "faq" && published == true]'

    if (tier) {
      query += ` | filter(tier == "${tier}")`
    }

    if (pageLocation) {
      query += ` | filter("${pageLocation}" in displayPages)`
    }

    query += ' | sort(priority asc)'

    const faqs = await client.fetch(query)

    return NextResponse.json(faqs)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('FAQ API error:', error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to fetch FAQs' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

---

## 4. UPDATE PAGE COMPONENTS TO USE FAQ COMPONENT
